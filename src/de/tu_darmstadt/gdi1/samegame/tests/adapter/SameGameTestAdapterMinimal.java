/**
 * This is the test adapter for the minimal stage of completion. You <b>must</b> implement the method stubs and match
 * them to your concrete implementation. Please read all the Javadoc of a method before implementing it. <br>
 * <strong>Important:</strong> this class should not contain any real game logic, you should rather only match the
 * method stubs to your game. <br>
 * Example: in {@link #isCorrectLevel()} you may return the value <i>myGame.isCorrectlevel()</i>, if you have a variable
 * <i>myGame</i> and a level has before been loaded via {@link #loadLevelFromString(String)}. What you mustn't do is to
 * implement the actual logic of the method in this class. <br>
 * <br>
 * If you have implemented the minimal stage of completion, you should be able to implement all method stubs. The public
 * and private JUnit tests for the minimal stage of completion will be run on this test adapter. The other test adapters
 * will inherit from this class, because they need the basic methods (like loading a level), too. <br>
 * <br>
 * The methods of all test adapters need to function without any kind of user interaction.</br>
 * 
 * <i>Note:</i> All other test adapters will inherit from this class.
